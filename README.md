# CodeKY-Project
This project is very simple to run and follow along with. It is structured in a notebook using Python (see version in 'requirements.txt') and essentially goes step by step.

Instructions:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub to your local environment (or peruse through at your leisure on GitHub's website).
2. cd into the correct folder (the folder you just cloned from GitHub). 'cd' refers to the command used in a shell environment to 'change directories'. This is a fancy way of saying that your are moving through different folders, but instead of pointing and clicking with a mouse you are using file paths.
3. Once you have moved to the correct directory, do a quick "ls -la" command in your shell just to make sure all the folders cloned properly. If you see the same files listed as are on GitHub, you're in the right place. If the files are not listed, try cloning the repository or making sure you've switched to the correct directory.
4. Activate your virtual environment (your 'venv' folder). On Windows, in GitBash shell, the command is                  ". venv/Scripts/activate". You'll know it worked if you see 'venv' in parenthesis on your shell window.
5. Install the requirements listed in the requirements.txt file so that your local environment can run the cells properly. In your shell window the command 'pip install > requirements.txt' should do just that.
6. Once all of that is complete, open the .ipynb file and enjoy!
